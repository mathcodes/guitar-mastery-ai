    "description": "Alternate picking is the foundation of efficient right-hand technique. It involves strictly alternating between downstrokes and upstrokes, regardless of string changes. This produces even, articulate notes and is essential for fast single-note passages.",
    "instructions": "1. Hold the pick between your thumb and index finger with a relaxed grip\n2. Start with a downstroke on any open string\n3. Follow immediately with an upstroke\n4. Keep the motion small — movement should come from the wrist, not the forearm\n5. Practice on a single string first at a slow tempo with a metronome\n6. When comfortable, practice crossing strings while maintaining strict alternation\n7. Use a metronome starting at 60 BPM, quarter notes, and gradually increase speed\n8. CRITICAL: Do not sacrifice evenness for speed. Both downstrokes and upstrokes should sound identical in volume and tone.",
    "common_errors": [
      "Using too much arm movement instead of wrist",
      "Gripping the pick too tightly, causing tension",

    "category": "fretting",
    "subcategory": "legato",
    "description": "Legato technique uses hammer-ons and pull-offs to sound notes without picking each one, creating a smooth, flowing, connected sound. The fretting hand does the work, allowing for rapid, fluid lines that are physically different from picked passages.",
    "instructions": "**Hammer-ons:**\n1. Pick a note normally\n2. 'Hammer' another finger onto a higher fret on the same string with enough force to sound the note clearly\n3. The hammer should be quick and precise — think of it as 'snapping' the finger down\n4. The hammered note should be as loud as the picked note\n\n**Pull-offs:**\n1. Fret two notes on the same string (e.g., index on 5th fret, ring on 7th fret)\n2. Pick the higher note\n3. Pull the higher finger slightly downward (toward the floor) as you lift it, 'plucking' the string\n4. The lower note should ring clearly\n\n**Combined:**\nLink hammer-ons and pull-offs in sequences (e.g., pick once, then hammer-pull-hammer-pull) for extended legato passages.",

    "description": "Playing melodies in octaves — the same note doubled an octave apart — was popularized by jazz guitar legend Wes Montgomery. The technique produces a fat, horn-like sound that cuts through a band. Wes used his thumb instead of a pick, giving his octaves a warm, rounded tone.",
    "instructions": "1. **Basic octave shape (strings 6&4)**: Fret a note on the 6th string with your index finger. The octave is 2 frets higher on the 4th string (fret with ring finger or pinky)\n2. **Mute the 5th string**: Lightly touch the 5th string with the underside of your index finger to mute it\n3. **Strum through all three strings**: The muted middle string is silent, but strumming through it feels natural and keeps rhythm steady\n4. **Adjacent string pairs**: The same concept works on strings 5&3, 4&2, and 3&1 (3&1 shape is 3 frets apart, not 2)\n5. **With thumb (Wes style)**: Use the fleshy part of the thumb for a warm tone\n6. **With pick**: Strum through with the pick for a brighter, more articulate sound\n7. **Play melodies**: Once comfortable with the shapes, play scale patterns, melodies, and solos entirely in octaves",

In a ii-V-I in C:\n   - Dm7 → G7: F (b7 of Dm7) resolves to B (3 of G7) — or C (b3) to B (3)\n   - G7 → Cmaj7: B (3 of G7) resolves to C (root) and F (b7) resolves to E (3)\n3. **Play just guide tone lines**: Pick one note per chord, connecting smoothly\n4. **Embellish**: Once the guide tone skeleton is solid, add passing tones, approach notes, and rhythmic variation\n5. **Apply to standards**: Practice over 'Autumn Leaves', 'All The Things You Are', and blues",

    "description": "Every guitarist hits plateaus — periods where progress seems to stall despite regular practice. This isn't failure; it's a normal part of skill development. The solution is not 'more practice' but 'different practice.' Plateaus signal that your current approach has delivered all it can, and you need new challenges to stimulate growth.",
    "instructions": "**Diagnose the Rut:**\n1. Are you playing the same licks/patterns in every solo? → You need new vocabulary\n2. Are you technically stuck (can't play faster/cleaner)? → Technique needs targeted work\n3. Are your solos boring even though you 'know the theory'? → You need rhythmic/phrasing development\n4. Do you avoid certain keys/positions? → Knowledge gaps need filling\n5. Can you play but not hear what you want to play? → Ear training is the bottleneck\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n1. **Learn something completely different**: If you only play jazz, learn a blues solo. If you only play lead, work on chord melody. Novel challenges create new neural pathways.\n\n2. **Transcribe by ear**: Pick a solo you love and learn it note-by-note by ear (not tabs). This is the single most effective practice activity in jazz education.\n\n3. **Impose constraints**: Solo using only one string. Solo using only chord tones. Play a tune in an uncomfortable key. Constraints force creativity.\n\n4. **Focus on rhythm, not notes**: Clap/tap the rhythms of solos you admire. Practice playing one note with great rhythm — this alone will transform your playing.\n\n5. **Slow way down**: Practice at 50% of your comfortable tempo. You'll discover sloppiness you didn't know existed.\n\n6. **Play with better musicians**: Nothing busts a plateau like trying to keep up with players above your level.\n\n7. **Record and listen back**: Your perception while playing is unreliable. Recording reveals the truth.\n\n8. **Take a break**: Sometimes 2-3 days away from the guitar lets your brain consolidate what you've been practicing.",
