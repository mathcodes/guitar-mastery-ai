## Core Principle: The ii-V-I Progression

The ii-V-I is the single most important chord progression in jazz. Understanding it unlocks 80% of jazz harmony.

**In Major Keys:**
- ii = minor 7th (Dm7 in C major)
- V = dominant 7th (G7 in C major)
- I = major 7th (Cmaj7 in C major)

**In Minor Keys:**
- ii = half-diminished / m7b5 (Dm7b5 in C minor)
- V = dominant 7th with alterations (G7b9, G7alt in C minor)
- i = minor 7th or minor 6th (Cm7 or Cm6)

**Scale choices for ii-V-I in C major:**
- Dm7 → D Dorian (D E F G A B C)
- G7 → G Mixolydian (unaltered) or G Altered (for tension)
- Cmaj7 → C Ionian or C Lydian

**Scale choices for ii-V-i in C minor:**
- Dm7b5 → D Locrian #2 (D E F G Ab Bb C)
- G7b9 → G HW Diminished or G Altered
- Cm → C Dorian or C Melodic Minor

## Voice Leading Principles

Voice leading is the art of moving smoothly from one chord to the next by moving each voice by the smallest possible interval.

**Key Rule**: The 3rd of one chord resolves to the 7th of the next (and vice versa):
- Dm7 (F is the b3) → G7 (F is the b7) — Common tone!
- G7 (B is the 3rd) → Cmaj7 (C is the root, B→C = half step)
- G7 (F is the b7) → Cmaj7 (E is the 3rd, F→E = half step)

This creates the smoothest possible chord movement.

## Improvisation Framework: From Simple to Complex

### Level 1: Chord Tones Only
Solo using only the 1, 3, 5, 7 of each chord. This forces you to hear the harmony.

### Level 2: Add Scale Tones
Fill in between chord tones with appropriate scale notes. Still target chord tones on strong beats.

### Level 3: Add Approach Notes
Approach chord tones from a half step below (chromatic approach), a half step above, or both (enclosure).

### Level 4: Add Tensions
Include 9ths, 11ths, 13ths, and altered notes on weaker beats, resolving to chord tones.

### Level 5: Superimposition
Play arpeggios or scales from related chords over the actual chord for "outside" sounds. Example: Play Ebmaj7 arpeggio over Cm7 to emphasize the b3, 5, b7, and 9.

## Practice Methodology — The S.M.A.R.T. Approach

- **Specific**: "Learn drop 2 voicings for ii-V-I in 3 keys" not "work on chords"
- **Measurable**: "Play Donna Lee at 160 BPM clean" not "get better at bebop"
- **Achievable**: Incremental goals that build on current ability
- **Relevant**: Directly connected to musical goals (gigging, jamming, etc.)
- **Time-bound**: "This week I will learn the melody to Autumn Leaves"

## Breaking Through Plateaus — Diagnostic Framework

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Prescription |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Same licks every solo | Limited vocabulary | Transcribe 2 solos this month |
| Can't play faster | Tension in hands | Slow down 50%, focus on relaxation |
| Solos sound "academic" | Not listening enough | Listen to 1 hour of jazz daily for 2 weeks |
| Lost in chord changes | Ear training deficit | Sing guide tones over backing tracks |
| Bored with practicing | Routine is stale | Plateau Buster 2-week program |
| Avoid certain keys | Positional dependence | One-string exercises in all keys |
| Can play but can't teach it | Theory gaps | Study Mark Levine's Jazz Theory Book |

## Comping Styles Quick Reference

**Freddie Green (Count Basie)**: Quarter notes on every beat, small voicings (3-4 strings), extremely consistent rhythm. The heartbeat of swing.

**Jim Hall**: Sparse, conversational comping. Uses space as much as notes. Responds to the soloist.

**Joe Pass**: Full chord melody approach even when comping. Walking bass + chords simultaneously.

**Pat Metheny**: Open voicings, quartal harmony, lush extensions. Modern jazz comping.

**John Scofield**: Funky, rhythmically displaced comping. Blues-influenced voicings with modern harmony.
