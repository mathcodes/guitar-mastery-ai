## Tonewood Reference Guide

### Soundboard Woods (Tops)

**Sitka Spruce** — The most common soundboard wood. Strong fundamental, broad dynamic range, works well for all playing styles. Used on most Martin and Taylor guitars.

**Adirondack (Red) Spruce** — The "holy grail" top wood. Stiffer and louder than Sitka, with a more complex overtone structure. Used on pre-war Martins and vintage Gibson archtops. Increasingly rare and expensive.

**European Spruce (German, Alpine, Italian)** — Wider grain, often with more overtone complexity than Sitka. Traditional choice for classical guitars and fine archtops. Stradivarius used Alpine spruce for his violins.

**Western Red Cedar** — Warmer, darker tone than spruce. Lower density means it responds well to a lighter touch. Preferred for classical and fingerstyle guitars. Used extensively by luthier José Ramirez III.

**Engelmann Spruce** — Lighter in color and weight than Sitka. Warm, sweet tone with good projection. Excellent for fingerstyle.

**Redwood** — Rich, warm, complex overtones. Extremely lightweight. Rare as a guitar tonewood but prized when available.

### Back & Side Woods

**Brazilian Rosewood (Dalbergia nigra)** — The most prized tonewood in history. Rich, complex, with sparkling highs and deep lows. CITES restricted since 1992 (international trade ban). Pre-ban instruments command massive premiums.

**East Indian Rosewood (Dalbergia latifolia)** — The standard rosewood replacement after Brazilian became unavailable. Warm, full, with good bass. Martin's D-28 has used Indian rosewood since the late 1960s.

**Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla)** — Warm, focused, strong midrange. Less bass and sparkle than rosewood but more "woody" and direct. Martin D-18, Gibson J-45. Excellent for singer-songwriters.

**Maple (Acer saccharum — hard; Acer macrophyllum — big leaf)** — Bright, clear, articulate. Reflects sound rather than adding color. The standard for archtop guitars, violins, and electric guitar bodies/necks. "Figured" maple (flame, quilted, bird's eye) is cosmetically prized.

**Koa (Acacia koa)** — Hawaiian endemic wood. Starts bright (similar to maple) and "opens up" with age to develop warmth approaching rosewood. Beautiful grain patterns.

**Sapele** — African mahogany relative. Similar tonal properties to mahogany with slightly more brightness. Common as a mahogany alternative.

**Cocobolo, Ziricote, Blackwood** — Exotic alternatives to rosewood, each with unique tonal and aesthetic properties.

### Neck Woods

**Mahogany** — Traditional choice for Gibson and most acoustic guitar necks. Warm, resonant, stable.

**Maple** — Standard for Fender electric guitars and many archtops. Hard, stable, bright.

**Spanish Cedar** — Traditional for classical guitar necks.

### Fingerboard Woods

**Ebony (Diospyros crassifolia)** — The premium fingerboard wood. Extremely hard, dense, and smooth. Bright, snappy, fast-feeling. Traditional on high-end acoustics, classical guitars, and archtops.

**Rosewood (various Dalbergia species)** — Slightly softer and warmer than ebony. Oily natural feel. Standard on most mid-to-high-end guitars.

**Maple** — Bright, snappy. Used on most Fender necks (often one piece with the neck).

**Richlite, Ebanol** — Composite alternatives developed as sustainable ebony substitutes. Martin and Gibson have adopted these.

## Construction Methods

### Bracing Patterns

**Fan Bracing** — Radiating struts below the soundhole. Developed by Torres for classical guitars. Optimized for nylon strings and fingerstyle playing.

**X-Bracing** — Two braces crossing below the soundhole in an X pattern. Martin's innovation for steel-string guitars. Provides structural support for steel string tension while allowing the top to vibrate.

**Scalloped X-Bracing** — X-bracing where the braces are thinned (scalloped) to reduce mass and increase top responsiveness. Used on pre-war Martins and reintroduced on modern "vintage-spec" guitars.

**Ladder Bracing** — Parallel braces running across the grain. Simple, used on early guitars and some archtops. Less structurally sophisticated but gives a particular "woody" tone.

**Lattice Bracing** — Grid pattern, sometimes with carbon fiber. Used by some modern classical builders for increased volume and projection.

### Neck Joints

**Dovetail Joint** — Traditional method used by Martin and Gibson on acoustics. Very strong, contributes to sustain, but makes neck resets complex.

**Bolt-On** — Fender's innovation. Four screws attach the neck to the body. Easy to replace/adjust, slightly brighter tone due to the mechanical coupling.

**Set Neck (Glued-In)** — Neck glued into a mortise in the body. Used by Gibson on electrics (Les Paul, SG, ES-335). Good sustain, warm coupling.

**Neck-Through** — Neck extends the full length of the body with "wings" glued on for the body shape. Maximum sustain. Used on some high-end basses and guitars.

## Guitar Categories & History

### Classical Guitar
- Developed by Torres (1850s)
- Nylon strings (formerly gut)
- Fan bracing
- 650mm scale length standard
- Wider neck (50-52mm nut width)

### Steel-String Acoustic
- Developed by Martin (1840s-1850s)
- X-bracing for steel string tension
- Body sizes: Parlor, 0, 00, 000/OM, Dreadnought, Jumbo
- 644-648mm scale length typical

### Archtop Guitar
- Developed by Orville Gibson (1890s), refined by Lloyd Loar (1920s)
- Carved spruce top, carved maple back
- F-holes
- Originally acoustic, later electrified
- The jazz guitar

### Solid-Body Electric
- Developed by Leo Fender (1950) and Gibson/Les Paul (1952)
- Solid wood body eliminates feedback
- Electromagnetic pickups convert string vibration to electrical signal
- Bolt-on (Fender) vs set neck (Gibson) debate

### Semi-Hollow Electric
- Gibson ES-335 (1958) — "thinline" with center block
- Combines archtop resonance with solid-body feedback resistance
- The versatile "do-everything" electric guitar
